# Optimal Problem Resolution Allocator

This project showcases an efficient and flexible optimization tool that efficiently allocates resources to solve problems across multiple clusters while considering their priority and associated costs. Designed using MiniZinc, this script provides an elegant and effective solution to the challenge of maximizing the resolution of high-priority problems within a given budget.

# Key features:

- Three separate problem clusters (ITEMA, ITEMB, ITEMC) with consecutive numbering
- Customizable priority levels (1-4) and costs for each problem
- Resource allocation optimization based on problem priorities and a fixed budget

With this Optimal Problem Resolution Allocator, users can explore various scenarios by modifying the priorities, costs, and available budget. The script returns the set of solvable problems, along with the amount of funds allocated to each cluster.

## Conclusions:

The Optimal Problem Resolution Allocator project is an excellent example of leveraging the power of optimization techniques and constraint programming to efficiently allocate resources across multiple clusters. This project not only highlights the versatility of MiniZinc but also showcases its applicability in real-world scenarios. By exploring this project, users can gain valuable insights into how data-driven decision-making can lead to better resource allocation and problem-solving in various domains.
